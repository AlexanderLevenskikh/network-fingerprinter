This directory contains several helper tools mentioned in ../README:

  p0f-sendsyn.c   - a tool for gathering new SYN+ACK signatures

  p0f-sendsyn6.c  - the same, for IPv6 destinations

  p0f-client.c    - simple API client tool for p0f -s mode

Note that IPv6 addresses need to be passed to the utilities in a fully-expanded
form (i.e., no ::).

To build any of these programs, simply type 'make progname', e.g.:

  make p0f-sendsyn

If that fails, you can drop me a mail at lcamtuf@coredump.cx.
